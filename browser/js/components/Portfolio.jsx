      <h3>My work</h3>
      <p>I've loved programming for a long time.  In middle school I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could make a good ol' Geocities page.  In high school, I graduated to studying C++ and Java.  My computer science skills lay dormant until I began taking online classes in Python, R, and SQL while working as a teacher.  The stack I am now most comfortable with is Node, Express,PostgresQl, React and Redux, though I am constantly learning new technologies.</p>
