    <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>A few weeks after graduating with a degree in biology, I boarded a plane to move to a part of the world I had never been to and where I knew no one.  I had landed a job as a high school biology teacher at <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/deerfield-in-the-desert" target="_blank"> a very interesting place</a> indeed.  Six years later, now living in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/26/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-santiago-chile.html?_r=0" target="_blank">another foreign land</a>, and after years of teaching not just biology, but some math too, I realized that as much as I loved the classroom, I was curious about what else I could be doing.  I had begun taking online classes in programming and machine learning purely out of curiousity when I decided to take the plunge and attend <a href="https://www.gracehopper.com/" target="_blank">an immersive coding bootcamp. </a> After graduating, I was selected to be a teaching fellow for the next cohort of students.</p>
      <p> Moving foward, I look to be programming for an organization whose mission I am passionate about.  Wherever I go, I will always be teaching and learning.  </p>
